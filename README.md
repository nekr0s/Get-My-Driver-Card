**<h1>Project purpose:</h1>**

*GetMyDriverCard saves you time by allowing you to make new requests for official tachograph card or replace an existing one.With its easy to use User interface you can navigate between different options and make a request for new card in just a few minutes . Login with custom user account, facebook or google account and get started!
The app is individualised depending on the user account type, although it is devoted to application forms , it also has an administrative part which allows authorities to accept your request and provide you with a new card once your request is approved. Once this happens you will be informed via notification. Keeping you informed is our priority, therefore we made checking the status of your ongoing request easy. After you have sumbited your request you will be redirected to a window that keeps track of your request history.
If you are tired of waiting in lines and keen on saving some time when you need your tachograph card ready for use - our app is the best choice for you.
